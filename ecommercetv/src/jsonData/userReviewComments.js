All items were present.\nI have to say this was the quickest set-up I've ever had for any type of device (T.V, PC, Laptop, Phone, etc.). Although I did a bit of research before I purchased this product.Then after I ordered it and while I was waiting for delivery I did a bit of reading on this site (reviews & Q&A's) just to have an 'edge' when it came time to set it up."

			"comment": "I purchased a TCL 32s301 tv to use it as a multi computer monitor in my office. It was only 720P but I was impressed by the quality of the picture. I do not do much gaming just an occasional flight sim. So when I saw this product was 1080P I thought to purchase it for my wife who plays lots of games on her computer."

			"comment": "For the price this tv is excellent. Yes I know it is only 1080p but for a bedroom tv it looks great and functions perfectly. For this price I feel I got more than what I paid for and thats always a plus Add a firestick and it's perfect. Edit: a wall mount for this is also a great addition."

			"comment": "I was looking for something nice for my room that was reasonably priced. I'm so happy I found this tv. The smart portion is very easy to use and the setup took about 20 min fairly quick. I use Netflix, YouTube and I have my direct TV on here also. The picture is very clear and I got a little soundbar to go with it. Nice bang for my buck. This is a great TV for a small room. I got the 40 for my living room and the 32 for my room. :) 32 is pictured!"
